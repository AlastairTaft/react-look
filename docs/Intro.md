# 1. Intro

> You made it to the documentation! First of all I would like to **thank** you for using Look and pushing it forward. Feel free to star or share if you like it. 

The following documentation pages will hopefully solve all your remaining questions and clear out the usage and intention of Look.<br>

If there's still something I forgot please let me know and don't be shy to ask. You may also create an issue so I can update the docs immediately.
