#  Media Queries

Look supports media-queries using a common syntax. There are actually two different ways to use them. You can either **nest** them within a valid selector or use it as a **wrapper** *(just like you would do it in CSS)* that contains selectors.

## Example
```javascript
let styles = {
	// nested media query
	box : {
		color: 'blue',
		fontSize: 20,
		background: '#fff',
		'@media (min-width: 800px)' : {
			color: 'red',
			background: 'gray'
		}
	}
	
	// wrapping media query
	'@media (min-width: 800px)' : {
		box : {
			color: 'blue',
			fontSize: 20
		},
		item : {
			lineHeight: 15,
			padding: '20px 0 20px 0'
		}
	}
}
```

Similar to pseudo classes, media queries can be nested. They can also include pseudo classes and stateful conditions.

## Validation
By default Look uses `window.matchMedia` to validate media queries. Though some browser don't support matchMedia. You may add a **polyfill** or **replace** it with your own. Please read on for more information.

## Server-side rendering
By now there is no "perfect" way to validate media queries on server-side without performance loss *(initial request to get client dimensions)* or without a chance to missmatch the size *(e.g. validation the `userAgent`)*.

### matchMedia API
Look's provides an [API](api/matchMedia.md) to replace the default validation method.
