# 6. Processors

Processors are a core feature of [Dynamic Style Sheet](https://github.com/dynamicstylesheets/Dynamic-Style-Sheets) to modify your styles dynamically.<br>
They're used to add **vendor prefixes**, **mixins** and stuff like that.

Check out the official [Processor Documentation](https://github.com/dynamicstylesheets/Dynamic-Style-Sheets#processors) for further information on how to use and especially **how to build your own**.

There's also a list with [Available Processors](https://github.com/dynamicstylesheets/Dynamic-Style-Sheets#available-processors)  which provides some core processors.

## Common
In order to simplify using processors and frequently used mixins I created a toolchain called [react-look-tools](https://github.com/rofrischmann/react-look-tools) which provides a set of useful predefined **mixins**, **functions** as well as a **developer tool** for maximum DX.
