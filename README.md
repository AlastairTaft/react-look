**Obscene Stylesheet** is a lightweight styling library built for use with [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/).    
It extends inline-styles with automated vendor prefixing, browser states and media queries which you may know from regular CSS.

> Note: Obscene Stylesheet is a core library & former part of [Obscene Layout](http://github.com/obscene/Obscene-Layout) which now remains *only* as a set of layouting components

## About
Inspired by [Cristopher Chedeau (@vjeux)](https://twitter.com/vjeux)'s presentation [CSS in JS](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js) with the idea of putting styling completely into javascript, we started building our own library to do so.    
There are plenty of implementations that do this job according to this [comparison](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js).
### Why this is not just another one
While most of them seem to handle those more complex CSS abilities quite well, none of them really go without CSS in the background.    
Most of the validate your given styles object, generate CSS code and add it via `<style></style>`-within your document.    
This might be the very first library to do all of this stuff truly with pure javascript!

## Roadmap
- [x] automated vendor-prefixing (flexbox included)
- [x] media queries
- [ ] :pseudo-classes `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, `:checked`, `:disabled` & `:enabled`
- [ ] CSS-export for non-React use
- [ ] multiple styles
- [ ] global styles

## Usage
Install via `npm`. Use `-save` if you'd like to add it to your *package.json*.    
```sh
npm install obscene-stylesheet
```


Now you can *require* it within your code.    
```javascript
var Stylesheet = require('obscene-stylesheet').Stylesheet;
```

### Stylesheet.create(styles *[, options]*)
Use this function to define your styles.    
It adds vendor prefixes if needed and resolves `@media` queries.    
This is much like you would define a stylesheet in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) too. e.g.    

> Note: We will add a detailed guide on how to use our media queries since they differ a bit of what you might know from CSS.

```javascript
var styles = stylesheet.create({
	header : {
		color: '#fff',
		padding: 20,
		fontSize : 12,
		color: 'black',
		fontSize: 20
	},
	box : {
		boxSizing: 'border-box',
		backgroundColor : 'blue'
	}
});
```

### Media Queries & Browser States
Detailed information on how to use media queries (mixin) and browser states as `:hover` is coming soon.    

### Knowledge Source
Information according the need of vendor prefixes were taken from [Richard Bradshaw's Guide](http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/which-vendor-prefixes-are-needed/) and [CanIUse](http://caniuse.com/).    
For further information about Flexbox check [Flexbox.md](Flexbox.md).    
This implementation is based on [Flexy Boxes](http://the-echoplex.net/flexyboxes/) according browser support and vendor prefixes.      
Default values were taken from [Guide to Flexbox  (css-tricks.com)](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).    
It automatically transforms properties to older specs properties such as `msFlexAlign` or `display: -webkit-box` if needed.

> **Warning**: If you've never used flexbox before please be sure to check both links above to properly understand it.
