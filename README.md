> **1.0 Release**: Look 1.0.0 is coming! Some minor API changes will happen. Changelog will be added soon.

**Look** is a **feature-rich** styling library for [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) based on **inline-styles** that adds support for lots of CSS features as well as **stateful** styles. It extends your inline styles and is fully customizable through processors since it is based on [Dynamic Style Sheets](https://github.com/dynamicstylesheets).

> It got inspired by [Cristopher Chedeau (@vjeux)](https://twitter.com/vjeux)'s presentation [CSS in JS](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js) as well as [Radium](http://projects.formidablelabs.com/radium/) and [ReactCSS](http://reactcss.com). <br>Be sure to read my blog post [React Component styling without limitations](https://medium.com/@rofrischmann/react-component-styling-without-limitations-84e5e776fd44) which gives detail information how and why I build Look.

# Features
Look is as far as I know the **feature richest** inline-styling library for React. <br>
Supporting [25 pseudo classes](docs/PseudoClasses.md) out of the box (many more via mixins) as well as **stateful styles** which is an awesome shortcut if you need some styles depending on any valid condition mostly used with `this.state` or `this.props`.
- ES6-ready & `React.createClass`
- [media queries](docs/MediaQueries.md)
- [pseudo classes](docs/PseudoClasses.md)
- [stateful styles](docs/StatefulConditions.md) (condition based)
- nesting
- [processors](docs/Processors.md)
- [mixins](docs/Mixins.md)
- [extending](#extending)
- [vendor prefixing](docs/VendorPrefixes.md)
- !important-notation
- modular & themeable
- useful APIs 

### [Supported pseudo classes](docs/PseudoClasses.md#supportedpseudoclasses)
# Benefit
Using inline styles instead of static CSS files has a lot of positive side-effects. The most important one is **dynamic behavior**.<br>Remember you're using JavaScript now. Your styles no longer belong to a static file but are just a plain javascript object which can be manipulated to fit your very own needs.

* **Component-scoped:** 
As JSX brings your HTML to javascript, Look adds your **styling** (CSS) as well.<br>
It encourages you to define your styles scoped to your Component which helps to improve your app structure and keeps together all Component-relevant data. One file less to create.
* **Separation of Concerns:**
Look tries to keep your styling separated from your logic as much as possible while other styling libraries often encourage style validations such as `this.state.checked && styles.checked` within your `render()`-method.

> **Warning:** Avoid using stateful conditions with data-sensitive states as this would mix logic and styles.

# Usage
The syntax is quite similar to [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and other React styling libraries. Use nested objects to define pseudo classes, media queries or conditioned styles. <br>

The example uses an ES7 Decorator `@Look`. Alternatively wrap your Component with Look. e.g. `Header = Look(Header)`<br>

```javascript
import {Component} from 'react';
import Look from 'react-look';

@Look
class Header extends Component {
  static defaultProps = {clicks: 24}
  constructor() {
    super(...arguments);
    this.state = {status: 'active'}
  }

  look(){
    return {
      header : {
        transition: '200ms all linear',
        // Use media queries, pseudo classes and stateful styles
        // using nested style objects. Those get evaluated 
        // on the fly and can be nested endlessly.
        '@media (min-height: 800px)' : { 
          fontSize: 13,
          ':hover' : {    
            fontSize: 15,
          }
        },
        'status=active' : {             
          backgroundColor: 'green',
          'clicks>=20' : {            
            backgroundColor: 'pink'       
          }
        }
      },
      title : {
        fontWeight: 800,
        fontSize: 20
      }
    }
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      // Apply your styles with the `look` property.
      // If you are only using single looks you may just drop the
      // selector and just use a plain `look` property.
      <header look="header">
        <h1 look="title">
          {this.props.title}
        </h1>
      </header>
    )
  }
}
```

# [Documentation](docs/Docs.md#tableofcontents)
I tried to write as much helpful documentation as possible. Before asking any question or creating an issue please be sure to read all the documentation.<br>
The documentation gives huge information on how to do all kind of stuff. It serves detailed information on how to use processors, mixins or react-look-tools.<br>
You will also find some information on how Look works at the core and what [Dynamic Style Sheets](https://github.com/dynamicstylesheets) is all about.

## How does Look work?
Similar to Radium, Look wraps the `render` function and modifies applied styles while iterating recursive over all children.

Check [Under the hood](docs/UnderTheHood.md) for more detailed information. 

## [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md)
> Unsupported pseudo classes?<br>
Less boilerplate / shortcuts?<br>
Additional styles & Processors?<br>
Server-side rendering?
